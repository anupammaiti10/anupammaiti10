# Hi, I'm Anupam Maiti üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
Here you'll find my projects and configuration files.

## üöÄ Languages & Technologies I Use

- **Python**
- **JavaScript**
- **EJS**
- **LangChain**
- ...and more!

Thank you for clarifying! Here‚Äôs an explanation of what each of these repositories is likely doing, based on their names:

1. **ChatApplication_with_Groq_Inference**
   - This repository likely contains a chat application that uses Groq‚Äôs inference API or engine (Groq is a company known for high-performance AI hardware and inference solutions). The project probably implements a conversational interface that leverages Groq‚Äôs technology to power responses.

2. **MCP_SERVER_CONNECT_WITH_CLAUDE_LLM**
   - This appears to be a server-side project (possibly with ‚ÄúMCP‚Äù standing for a specific platform or architecture) that connects to the Claude LLM (Large Language Model) by Anthropic. It likely provides backend logic for sending and receiving messages to/from Claude for tasks such as chat, Q&A, or automation.

3. **NexaMeet**
   - Based on the name, this repository is probably a meeting or conferencing solution‚Äîperhaps similar to Zoom or Google Meet. It may include features like real-time video/audio, chat, scheduling, or meeting management.

4. **CREATE_AGENTS_USING_LANGCHAIN_WITH_TOOLS**
   - This repo likely includes code to create AI agents using [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), a popular framework for building language-model-powered applications. The ‚Äúwith tools‚Äù part suggests these agents can access external tools or APIs (e.g., web search, databases) beyond basic chat.

5. **CREATE11-RETRIVER_TOOLS_WITH_CHROMA_DB**
   - This project probably demonstrates how to build 11 different retriever tools using [Chroma DB](https://docs.trychroma.com/), an open-source embedding database for AI applications. Retrievers are components that fetch relevant documents or data given a query, commonly used in RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipelines.

**Summary Table:**

| NexaMeet                                     | Meeting/video conferencing solution, possibly with real-time features                       |
| CREATE_AGENTS_USING_LANGCHAIN_WITH_TOOLS     | Code for building automated agents using LangChain and external tools                       |
| CREATE11-RETRIVER_TOOLS_WITH_CHROMA_DB       | Examples of 11 retriever tools using Chroma DB for document or data retrieval               |

If you need details about the code, setup, or specific features of any of these repos, let me know which one and what kind of information you need (e.g., README summary, main files, usage instructions, etc.)!
